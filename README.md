# C++ Programs
This repository contains a collection of simple C++ programs aimed at demonstrating basic concepts and operations in C++. Below are the details of the programs included:

## 1. Basic Programs

### Aim:
To write simple C++ programs that demonstrate basic operations such as printing a message, calculating the sum and average of numbers, determining if a number is odd or even, and checking if a year is a leap year.

### Theory:
These programs introduce fundamental concepts in C++ programming:
Hello World: Demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program and how to output text to the console.
Sum, Average, Odd-Even: Shows how to perform arithmetic operations, use conditional statements, and calculate the sum and average of numbers.
Leap Year: Explains how to use conditional logic to determine if a given year is a leap year.

### Explanation:
Hello World: The program includes the necessary header files and uses the standard output stream to print "Hello World" to the console.
Sum, Average, Odd-Even: These programs take input from the user, perform arithmetic calculations to find the sum and average, and use conditional statements to check if a number is odd or even.
Leap Year: This program uses conditional statements to check the divisibility rules that define a leap year.

### Conclusion:
These basic programs provide a solid foundation for understanding C++ syntax and basic operations. 
They illustrate how to use input/output streams, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements, which are essential for more complex programming tasks.

## 2. Size of Different Data Types

### Aim:
To write a C++ program that determines the size of different data types.

### Theory:
Understanding the size of various data types is crucial for memory management and optimization in programming. 
Different data types (e.g., int, float, double, char) occupy different amounts of memory.

### Explanation:
The program uses the sizeof operator to determine and display the size of various data types in bytes. It includes common data types such as int, float, double, char, and others.

### Conclusion:
This program helps in understanding how much memory is allocated for different data types, which is important for writing efficient and optimized code.

## 3. Different Operators
### Aim:
To write C++ programs that demonstrate the use of different operators such as arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators.

### Theory:
Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. 
Understanding how to use different operators is fundamental to performing calculations, assigning values, and making comparisons in programming.

###Explanation:
Arithmetic Operators: Demonstrate basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
Assignment Operators: Show how to assign values to variables using =, +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=.
Comparison Operators: Illustrate how to compare values using ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.

### Conclusion:
These programs provide a clear understanding of how to use various operators in C++.
Mastery of operators is essential for performing calculations, making decisions, and controlling the flow of a program.
